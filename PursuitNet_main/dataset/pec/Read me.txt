TIMESTAMP: The timestamp indicates the specific time at which the data was recorded. In this example, the timestamp is measured in seconds.
TRACK_ID: The tracking ID is used to uniquely identify each tracked subject (robotic bait or mice). Here, a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is used. 
OBJECT_TYPE: The object type specifies whether the recorded data belongs to the robotic bait (BAIT) or a mouse (MICE).
X: The X coordinate represents the position of the subject in a two-dimensional space, measured in pixel.
Y: The Y coordinate, together with the X coordinate, determines the subject's position in two-dimensional space.
SPEED: Velocity indicates the rate of movement of the subject at the recorded timestamp, measured in centimeters per second.
ACCELERATION: Acceleration represents the rate of change of the subject's speed. The unit is typically centimeters per second squared.
SOURCE: The data source indicates from which experimental batch or recording device the data was obtained. This helps in tracking the origin of the data and managing it.
